### Input: <br>
#### Design code to correctly read the course data file. The program you will submit will be a command-line program written in C++. You will prompt the user to ask for the file name that contains the course data and read that file into course objects that are stored in your chosen data structure. Your data structure will hold course objects.

### Menu: <br>
#### Design code to create a menu that prompts a user for menu options. The menu should include the following options:
-	Load Data Structure: Load the file data into the data structure. Note that before you can print the course information or the sorted list of courses, you must load the data into the data structure.

-	Print Course List: This will print an alphanumeric list of all the courses in the Computer Science department.

-	Print Course: This will print the course title and the prerequisites for any individual course.

-	Exit: This will exit you out of the program.

-	Loading Data Structure: Develop working code to load data from the file into the data structure.
-	Course List: Develop working code to sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order (including all math courses). To print out a course list, use the pseudocode you created previously to guide your work. Then, create code that will allow advisers to print a course list in alphanumeric order. 

#### This code should do the following:
-	Sort the course information alphanumerically from lowest to highest.

-	Print the sorted list to a display.

-	Course Information: Develop working code to print course information. This code allows users to look up a course and print out information about its title and prerequisites. The program will prompt the user to enter the courseNumber. It will then print out the name of the course along with the prerequisite courseNumbers and titles.

-	Industry Standard Best Practices: Applying industry standard best practices in code design. This program displays an error message when user input does not fall within parameters. I also used in-line comments and appropriate naming conventions to enhance readability and maintainability.
