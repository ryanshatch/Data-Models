    HashTable Constructor
        Resize nodes to tableSize and initialize with nullptr

    HashTable Destructor
        Erase nodes from beginning to end

    Method Hash(bidId)
        Initialize hashValue to 0
        For each character in bidId
            Multiply hashValue by 31 and add ASCII value of character
        Return hashValue modulo tableSize

    Method Insert(bid)
        Generate key using Hash(bidId)
        If no node at key
            Insert new Node at key
        Else
            Find the end of the list and attach new Node

    Method PrintAll()
        For each node in the table
            Print bid information

    Method Remove(bidId)
        Generate key using Hash(bidId)
        If bid is found at key
            Remove bid and manage pointers

    Method Search(bidId)
        Generate key using Hash(bidId)
        If bid is found at key
            Return bid
        Else
            Return empty bid

    Method main()
        Process command line arguments for CSV file and bidKey
        Initialize hash table
        While user choice not equal to 'Exit'
            Display menu options
            Get user choice
            Perform action based on choice:

                Display All Bids: Call PrintAll()
                Find Bid: Call Search(bidKey) and measure time
                Remove Bid: Call Remove(bidKey)
