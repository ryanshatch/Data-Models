## What was the problem you were solving in these projects?
These projects primarily revolved around the ability to solve a problem by using in depth data manipulation and retrieval with C++ applications. Although the goal was to not be very code intensive, but to spend more time engaging with the data structures and the different ways that the data can be handled. By focusing on different data structures, I was able to learn the best ways to use operations like search, sort, and access, which are the main ways that data is manipulated in data structures.

##

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I used C++ to implement advanced data structures such as Binary Trees, Hash Tables, Linked Lists, and Vectors and conducted a detailed runtime analyses and reviews based off of the specific data structure and its ability to solve particular data handling issues efficiently, which help to show how important data organization is along with the access methods used in the development of the program.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Some of the challenges that arose were memory management errors, inefficiencies in the initial implementations, and the recursive algorithms. I addressed this through extensive debugging, testing performance, and using side by side comparisons in order to appropriately leverage C++ features like pointers and templates in order to help me impliment and optimize the correct data structure for the task.

##

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on these projects has helped to properly introduce and emphasize how crucial data structures are for software architecture. This helped me to recognize and prioritize scalability and efficiency in design. I was taught how to integrate complex data structures early in the design process to support high-performance applications.

##

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working with data structures has helped me to better maintain readability and structured logic. I have also been able to practice thoroughly how to clearly comment and adhere to the next developer that would be working with the software and data structure. Practicing on C++ best practices has helped me become more adaptable and helped me to design code for programs that can be easily adaptable and upgraded to larger scale data structures or algorithms.

Comparing these data structures in different scenarios to identify the most suitable ones for specific tasks.
Overcoming Roadblocks
Key challenges included:

Optimization of data structures for specific tasks.
Managing memory and processing overheads in complex data operations.
Ensuring accurate and efficient data retrieval and updates.
These were overcome through iterative testing, performance tuning, and leveraging insights from side-by-side comparisons.
Impact on Software Design
This project profoundly influenced my software design approach by:

Emphasizing the critical role of choosing appropriate data structures based on application requirements.
Highlighting the impact of data structure choice on overall software efficiency and performance.
Evolution of Programming Practices
From this project, I have evolved my programming practices to focus more on:

Maintainability - by writing clearer, well-documented code that follows best practices.
Readability - by structuring code logically and using consistent naming conventions.
Adaptability - by designing software with flexibility to accommodate changes and enhancements."# Data-Models"  -->
